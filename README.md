# US Accident Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing traffic accident data in the United States. The analysis explores patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accidents using a dataset of reported incidents.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares raw accident data for analysis by handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes accident trends by:
  - Time (hour, day, month, year)
  - Location (states, cities)
  - Weather and environmental conditions
- **Insights**: Identifies factors influencing accident severity, frequency, and distribution.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nireey/Accident_Analysis_US.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Accident_Analysis_US
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook us_accident_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells step-by-step to execute the analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [US Accident Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Ensure that you have the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Outputs

- Visualizations and tables that summarize accident trends.
- Insights into accident-prone locations, times, and conditions.
